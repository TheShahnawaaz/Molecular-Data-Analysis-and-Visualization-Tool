Molecular-wide Electron Density (De)localization Atomic Counts (MOWed-LAC)
Project Description
The Molecular-wide Electron Density (De)localization Atomic Counts (MOWed-LAC) is a desktop GUI application designed to process raw data from computational chemistry software and convert it into well-organized, research-ready Excel formats. This tool was developed under the supervision of Prof. Ignacy Cukrowski at the Natural and Agricultural Sciences Department, University of Pretoria, South Africa.

Features
GUI Tool Development: Utilized the Tkinter library to create an intuitive graphical user interface.
Data Processing: Automated the conversion of complex textual outputs into organized Excel sheets.
User Inputs: Enhanced data analysis with user-driven inputs for numerical and graphical insights.
Libraries Utilized: Employed essential libraries such as os, openpyxl, subprocess, Pillow, numpy, re (regular expression), pickle, and auto-py-to-exe.
Executable Conversion: Converted Python scripts into executable (.exe) files for user convenience.

Installation
To run the MOWed-LAC application, you need to have the AIMAll generated folder *.atomicfiles and a *.wfx file, as well as a *.png or *.jpg picture of your molecular system (preferably as a QTAIM molecular graph). For convenience, consider placing these files in a dedicated MOWed-LAC folder where outputs generated by this application will be saved.

Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MOWed-LAC.git
Navigate to the directory:

sh
Copy code
cd MOWed-LAC
Install the required dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

sh
Copy code
python mowd_lac.py
Usage
Generate FALDI-pops.sum file: Click on the "Generate FALDI-pops.sum file" button to start processing.
Choose FALDI-pops.sum file: Alternatively, you can choose an existing FALDI-pops.sum file.
Enter Molecular Data: Provide the molecule system name, number of molecules, and unique molecule names with atom numbers.
Set Covalent Bond Threshold: Adjust the covalent bond minimum electrons shared threshold as needed.
Submit: Click the "Submit" button to generate the Excel file with refined data.
Advanced Features
Appearance Mode: Switch between dark and light modes.
GUI Scaling: Adjust the scaling of the GUI for better readability.
Help Window: Access detailed help information for each screen by pressing Ctrl-H.
